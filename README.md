# Global Pharmaceutical Trade Analytics
D3.js project I did during the quarantine to analyze how inter-dependent countries are for pharmaceutical supplies, in an attempt to answer why certain countries respond better or worse than others to wide-spread diseases, such as the Covid-19 pandemic.

### Description
The strength of a pharmaceutical industry is a major determiner of how safe and streamlined drug development process in a country can be; and the development of medicines and vaccines are among the most effective ways to alleviate and cure diseases. Therefore, a country's (in)dependence in the pharmaceutical supplies plays an important role in the country's ability tackle medical problems on its own.

<ins>With the new coronavirus Covid-19 taking over the world at an unprecedented pace, this project is a timely analysis of the independence of countries in pharmaceutics as a factor of how effective they can be in responding to such highly contagious diseases.</ins>
