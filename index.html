    <h3 class="textStyle" style="margin-bottom: -5px; text-align: center;">Definitions</h3>
    <p class="textStyle" style="padding-left: 20px;"><b>Bilateral Trade:</b> Exchange of goods between a unique pair of countries<br/>
    <b>Choropleth:</b> A thematic map in which individual areas are colored based on a statistical variable or geographic characteristics.<br/>
    <b>Hierarchical Edge Bundling:</b> A type of chart that visualizes adjacency relations between the individual entities organized in a hierarchy.

    <h3 class="textStyle" style="margin-bottom: -5px; text-align: center;">Description</h3>
    <p class="textStyle" style="padding-left: 20px;"><span class="textFirstLetter">T</span>he strength of a pharmaceutical industry is a major determiner of
        how safe and streamlined drug development process in a country can be; and the development of medicines and vaccines are among the most effective
        ways to alleviate and cure diseases. Therefore, a country's independence in the pharmaceutics plays an important role in the country's ability tackle
        medical problems on its own. <br/><br/>With the new coronavirus Covid-19 taking over the world, this project is a timely analysis of the independence of
        countries in pharmaceutics as a factor of how effective they can be in responding to such epidemics or diseases.

    <h3 class="textStyle" style="margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;">Dataset</h3>
    <div class="textStyle" style="padding-left: 20px; ">
        <span class="textFirstLetter">A</span>ll statistical information used for this project was taken from the following website of World Trade Organization (WTO):
        <a href="https://timeseries.wto.org/" target="_blank">https://timeseries.wto.org/</a><br><br>
        The dataset used here corresponds to the bilateral imports of pharmaceutical products by country in 2017. A full list of the 
        product categories taken into account can be found here: <a href="http://localhost:3000/products.txt" target="_blank">Product Categories</a><br>
        The dataset contains
        <ul class="textStyle" style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: -5px">
            <li>177 unique countries across the globe.</li>
            <li>41,192 rows of information, each corresponding to a unique bilateral trade.</li>
            <li>$757,695,450,733.215 worth of trades in total (about $758 billion)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="textStyle" style="margin-bottom: -5px; text-align: center;">Visualizations</h3>
    <p class="textStyle" style="padding-left: 20px;"><span class="textFirstLetter">T</span>hree different types of visualizations were used to analyze the dataset from three unique perspectives.<br/><br/>
    <b>Choropleth:</b> This chart provides a global perspective into the trades of pharmaceutical products to get an understanding of the top importer or exporter country and regions.<br/>
    <b>Histogram:</b> To investigate the important exporters of the top importers, a histogram was created with a dynamic country filtering functionality.<br/>
    <b>Hierarchical Edge Bundling:</b> An analysis of the dependence of countries in pharmaceutical trades would not be complete without a HEB that allows for a deeper look into mutual relations of
    countries and even continents.

    <h3 class="textStyle" style="margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;">Limitations</h3>
    <p class="textStyle">
        <span class="textFirstLetter">P</span>harmaceutical product trade scale of a country has many underlying factors that are not taken into account 
        in this project. Thus, the statements included in this work should not be considered to have full accuracy or encompass the topic in its entirety,
        although the project provides useful perspectives into the streams of large trades that give important clues on the medical dependence of certain
        countries or regions. For this reasons, there is room for improvement, to extend the discussion further to analyze other noteworthy factors that
        take part in bilateral trades.<br/><br/>
        The project make abundant use of visualizations; however, some modifications can me made for technical or visual improvements. For example,
        the values of mutual total trades could be displayed on the lines of the HEB, to get a better understanding of the volume of corresponding trade.
